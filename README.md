# DNA-Alignment-and-De-Brujin-Graphs


This project tackles the complex task of genetic sequence alignment and assembly using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and De Bruijn graphs. Our main goals include extracting substrings from large DNA sequences, building and visualizing De Bruijn graphs, applying the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment, integrating alignment with De Bruijn graphs to identify overlaps, and calculating similarity percentages to assess alignment quality.

Integrating De Bruijn graphs with sequence alignment is vital for comparing genetic sequences, predicting functional regions in genomic DNA, and studying evolutionary relationships and mutations. This approach helps efficiently represent sequence data and facilitates genome assembly from short reads. However, it faces challenges such as managing diverse genetic sequences, high computational demands, sequencing errors, and the complexities of repetitive regions and gene duplications.

We used the DNA of Drosophila melanogaster, approximately 180 million base pairs, and a dataset of protein sequences from various organisms sourced from the NCBI. The DNA sequences are read from a FASTA file, and substrings are extracted and written to a CSV file for further analysis. These substrings are used to construct De Bruijn graphs, which represent fixed-length overlaps between substrings and are crucial for genome assembly.

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, a dynamic programming approach for global sequence alignment, involves creating and initializing score and traceback matrices, assigning scores for matches, mismatches, and gaps, calculating scores iteratively, and reconstructing the optimal alignment. This helps identify evolutionary relationships, functional elements, and mutation effects. Our implementation aligns pairs of sequences, calculates similarity percentages, constructs De Bruijn graphs, finds common paths, and visualizes the results. The algorithm's performance was compared with the Biopython pairwise2 function, showing a cumulative error percentage of approximately 0.0441%. Matrix filling was the most time-consuming step, suggesting potential optimization through parallel processing.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effective integration of sequence alignment and De Bruijn graphs for genetic sequence analysis. These techniques enhance our understanding of genomic structures and evolutionary relationships, providing a foundation for further research and applications in bioinformatics.


This project has several real-life applications across various fields of biology and bioinformatics:

1.Genome Assembly: De Bruijn graphs are crucial for reconstructing whole genomes from fragmented DNA sequencing data, such as those generated by next-generation sequencing technologies. They help in piecing together short reads into longer contiguous sequences, thereby facilitating genome assembly.

2.Disease Diagnosis and Treatment: By accurately aligning and comparing genetic sequences, this project can aid in identifying genetic variations associated with diseases. This information is vital for understanding disease mechanisms, developing diagnostics, and designing personalized treatment strategies.

3.Evolutionary Studies: By aligning sequences from different species or individuals within a species, researchers can study evolutionary relationships, trace genetic mutations over time, and understand how species diverge and adapt to different environments.

4.Functional Genomics: Identifying functional regions in genomic DNA through sequence alignment helps in annotating genes, regulatory elements, and non-coding RNAs. This knowledge is crucial for understanding gene function and regulation.

5.Phylogenetics: Aligning genetic sequences allows researchers to construct phylogenetic trees, depicting evolutionary relationships between organisms. This information is used in biodiversity studies, conservation efforts, and understanding the spread of infectious diseases.

6.Drug Discovery: Sequence alignment plays a role in identifying potential drug targets by comparing genetic sequences of pathogens or disease-related genes with those of humans or model organisms. This aids in developing targeted therapies and drugs.

7.Agricultural Biotechnology: Understanding genetic variations in crop plants through sequence alignment helps in breeding programs to develop new varieties with desirable traits such as disease resistance, yield improvement, and nutritional content.

8.Environmental Microbiology: By analyzing microbial diversity and community composition through sequence alignment, researchers can assess environmental health, study microbial interactions, and monitor ecosystem changes.
